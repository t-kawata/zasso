# llm-bridge Agent Guide

This repository is a Rust 2024 workspace for `llm-bridge`. These rules are mandatory for Claude-based agents working in this repo.

## Non-negotiables

- Never enter plan mode automatically.
- Do not commit, push, merge, deploy, install dependencies, or change ticket state without explicit user permission.
- Never run `cargo clean`; ask first if it is truly required.
- Never write `TODO`, `todo!()`, temporary stubs, or incomplete code. If blocked, stop, reassess the design, and implement the complete solution.
- Remove dead code instead of suppressing it. Do not add deprecation layers unless explicitly requested.
- Never expose secrets in commands, logs, URLs, comments, errors, or tool arguments.

## Working Process

- Start by understanding the relevant files, symbols, tests, and specs before editing.
- Keep changes minimal, cohesive, and aligned with SOLID, DRY, and KISS.
- Prefer existing Makefile targets. For new automation, add a `Makefile` target instead of ad-hoc shell scripts.
- For dependency, Helm chart, or external-resource changes, check current upstream usage first. Put deep research under `docs/research/` after checking existing research.
- If completing a milestone, sync phase status in:
  - `README.md`
  - `README.zh-CN.md`
  - `specs/90-protocol-transform-roadmap.md`
  - `specs/91-protocol-transform-impl-plan.md`

## Required Validation

- Before finishing code changes, run `make ci`.
- If `make ci` is not available or too broad for the current iteration, run the smallest useful subset first, then CI before final handoff:
  - `cargo build`
  - `cargo test`
  - `cargo +nightly fmt`
  - `cargo clippy -- -D warnings -W clippy::pedantic`
- Run `cargo audit` regularly and use `cargo-deny` for license and banned-crate policy.
- Do not hide failing checks. Diagnose, fix, and rerun; ask the user only when blocked.

## Rust Baseline

- Use Rust 2024 and pin the latest stable toolchain in `rust-toolchain.toml`.
- Forbid unsafe code at crate roots with `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`.
- Enable core lint coverage with `#![warn(rust_2024_compatibility, missing_docs, missing_debug_implementations)]`.
- All public items require documentation, including examples where useful and `# Errors`, `# Panics`, or `# Safety` sections when applicable.
- Derive or implement `Debug` for all types; redact sensitive fields manually.

## Error Handling

- Never use `unwrap()` or `expect()` in production code.
- Return `Result<T>` for fallible operations; do not use `Option<T>` to hide errors.
- Use `thiserror` for library/domain error enums and `anyhow` for application-level context.
- Add context with `.context()` or `.with_context()` when propagating errors.
- Panics are acceptable only for truly unrecoverable application bugs, never for library errors or external input.

## Type and API Design

- Make illegal states unrepresentable with newtypes, enums, `NonZero*`, and private fields.
- Prefer `From`, `TryFrom`, and `FromStr` for conversions; prefer `winnow` for custom grammars.
- Use `typed-builder` for structs with more than five fields; simple constructors are fine for small types.
- Mark library-facing structs `#[non_exhaustive]` when future fields are likely.
- Do not use `Option<T>` when `T` has a natural empty/default value such as `Vec`, `HashMap`, or `HashSet`.
- Prefer explicit public API types over `impl Trait`; use `impl Trait` for internal helpers.

## Async and Concurrency

- Use Tokio with explicit features, for example `rt-multi-thread` and `macros`.
- Prefer actors and message passing over shared mutable state.
- Use `tokio::sync::mpsc` for MPSC and `flume` when a faster channel is justified.
- For non-`Send`/`Sync` resources, isolate ownership in a dedicated actor/thread instead of wrapping them in locks.
- Prefer `DashMap` over `Mutex<HashMap>` or `RwLock<HashMap>` for concurrent maps.
- Use `ArcSwap` for infrequently updated shared configuration.
- Handle all spawned task results and panics; prefer `JoinSet` for groups of tasks.
- Avoid blocking inside async code; use `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` when required.
- Use native async traits unless object safety requires `async-trait`; document that reason at module level.

## Input, Security, and Resource Boundaries

- Treat every value crossing HTTP, IPC, file, env, CLI, deserialization, or queue boundaries as hostile until validated.
- Validate immediately at deserialization/parse boundaries; reject invalid data instead of sanitizing it.
- Bound all externally supplied strings by byte length, all collections by element count, and all numbers by explicit ranges.
- Use charset allowlists for identifiers and slugs; avoid blocklists.
- Prevent path traversal by rejecting `..`, absolute paths, NUL bytes, and separators before canonicalization.
- Prevent SSRF by parsing URLs, allowlisting schemes, rejecting private/loopback/link-local targets, and pinning resolved IPs.
- Use parameterized database APIs; never format user input into SQL.
- Use argv-form process execution; never concatenate user input into shell commands.
- Use `regex` for untrusted text matching; cap untrusted regex pattern size before compilation.
- Add request body limits, timeouts, concurrency caps, recursion limits, decompression limits, and rate limits at trust boundaries.
- Use checked, saturating, or explicitly wrapping arithmetic for external numeric input.

## Cryptography and Secrets

- Use `rustls` with the `aws-lc-rs` backend for TLS in new code.
- Use constant-time comparison for tokens, MACs, signatures, password hashes, and similar secrets.
- Use Argon2id for password hashing with parameters tuned for at least 250 ms on target hardware.
- Use OS randomness (`OsRng` or `getrandom`) for security-sensitive keys, tokens, nonces, and IDs.
- Wrap secrets with `secrecy` types and assert redacted `Debug` output in tests for custom secret-bearing types.
- Load secrets from environment or secret managers only; never hard-code or commit `.env*` files.
- Design key and token systems for rotation with multiple active keys.

## Serialization and Configuration

- Use strongly typed `serde` models. Use `serde_json::Value` only for truly dynamic schemas.
- Use `#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]` for JSON types.
- Use `#[serde(alias = "...")]` for backward compatibility and `#[serde(default)]` for defaultable fields.
- Use `#[serde(skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none")]` to omit null JSON fields.
- Validate deserialized data immediately, with custom deserializers or validated newtypes when needed.
- Prefer the `config` crate and YAML files for runtime-tunable configuration; keep compile-time constants in code.

## Testing

- Add or update tests with every behavior change.
- Put unit tests in the same file under `#[cfg(test)] mod tests`; use `tests/` for integration tests.
- Name tests with `test_should_...` and cover error paths explicitly with `matches!` where appropriate.
- Use `rstest` for parameterized cases and `proptest` for invariants.
- Use `mockall` or `wiremock` only when isolation is valuable; prefer fast real implementations.
- Use doc tests for public examples. Mark slow tests `#[ignore]` and run them in CI when relevant.

## Logging and Observability

- Use `tracing`; never use `println!` or `dbg!` in production code.
- Prefer structured fields over string concatenation, especially for user-controlled values.
- Use `error!`, `warn!`, `info!`, `debug!`, and `trace!` intentionally.
- Add `#[instrument]` to meaningful async boundaries and skip large or sensitive parameters.
- Use JSON logging for production and human-readable output for local development.

## Performance

- Profile before optimizing.
- Avoid unnecessary allocation and cloning; prefer borrowing, `Arc`, `Cow<str>`, and `Bytes` where appropriate.
- Preallocate with `Vec::with_capacity()` when final size is known.
- Prefer iterators and small focused functions.
- Consider `SmallVec` or `smallbox` only when profiling or data shape justifies it.
- Add Criterion benchmarks only after behavior stabilizes.

## Dependencies

- Minimize dependency count and prefer pure Rust crates over FFI bindings.
- Use workspace dependencies for shared crates.
- Pin intentionally: `~` for patch-only updates when needed, default caret requirements for normal minor updates.
- Audit maintenance status, security history, and code quality before adding a dependency.
- Use package managers for dependency changes; do not manually edit lockfiles or manifests for installs/upgrades.

## Documentation and Specs

- For specs, inspect `specs/`, place new files there, name them `{feature-name}-{type}.md`, and update `specs/index.md`.
- Valid spec types include `prd`, `design`, `impl-plan`, `verification-plan`, and `review`.
- For docs, inspect `docs/`, place new files there, and update `docs/index.md`.
- If documentation was not explicitly requested but is useful, still place it under `docs/` and link it from the index.

## Code Style

- Import order: standard library, external dependencies, local modules.
- Use specific imports and refer to imported names directly; avoid fully qualified paths in implementations except for macros.
- Follow Rust naming conventions: `snake_case`, `PascalCase`, and `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`.
- Keep functions under 100 lines where practical; split complex logic into named helpers.
- Order items consistently: imports, constants, types, functions, tests.
- Use trailing commas in multi-line calls and literals.
- Run rustfmt rather than hand-formatting.

## Clippy Pedantic Alignment

All code must pass `cargo clippy -- -D warnings -W clippy::pedantic`. Prefer these idioms:

- `x.map_or(a, f)` instead of `x.map(f).unwrap_or(a)`.
- `v.and_then(Value::as_u64)` instead of redundant closures.
- `"value: {x}"` instead of positional format arguments.
- Backtick identifiers in docs, including environment variables and fields.
- Combine same-body match arms with `|`; keep wildcard arms last.
- Restructure instead of using needless `continue`.
- Collapse nested `if` expressions when conditions can be combined.
- Use `&str` instead of `String` for non-consuming parameters.
- Add `#[must_use]` to pure value-returning functions.
- Avoid wildcard imports and similar-looking variable names.
- Use `.try_into()` for lossy conversions and `.into()` or `as` only for provably lossless ones.
- Return the inner type when a function always returns `Some` or `Ok`.
- Prefer one-pass `.filter_map(f)` over `.filter().map()` or `.map().flatten()`.
